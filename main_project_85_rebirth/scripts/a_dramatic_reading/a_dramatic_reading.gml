return @"A dramatic reading of Smooth Speaking Sal's 'Yonder Horizon, Over there'

-soft-
The whisper of the evening breeze
Sweet pollen of the honey bees
Wafts throughout the waving trees
Causing some to stop and -loud-  SNEEZE

-passionate-
On this ground we find our pain
Over there we see pure gain
Golden sands of perfect stain
But none can find boredom's -anger- BANE

-frustrated-
Yonder sight of open night
I cannot fight the tempting light
It beckons me to take the plight
-accentuate beats- The FLIGHT of MIGHT that KITES my SIGHT

-proclaim-
The yonder horizon over there
Is not more than -evil- a jagged snare
-dramatic evil- It steals your breath with poison air
Now you know -inquisitive- but will you care?

-build intensity-
The sugar sweet and tempting flame
-build again-
The risky play and danger game
-build again-
Will you resist the great infame?
-somber-
Or ignore your royal claim?

A dramatic reading of Smooth Speaking Sal's 'Yonder Horizon, Over there'";
