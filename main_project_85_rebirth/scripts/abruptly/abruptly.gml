return @"Poetry
It's free
If you give someone money for it
Money
Like honey
Sweet, but you may get stung
Pain
Lightning in rain
Out of nowherer it fires
Fire
From match or liar
Both are destructive
Destruction
no instruction
Things crumble, things fall
Fall
All
All things end
End

...Abruptly...
Smooth Speaking Sal";
