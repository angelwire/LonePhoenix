return @"There was a tree one day
With apples on the way
But the farmer wanted cherries
And every night he'd pray:

'Lord, I want the tree
To give its fruit to me
But apples aren't good enough
I want cherries, you see'

The Lord replied with care:
'Hey down there,
The rules are quite fair,

Pears produce pears
Bears produce bears
And Fish don't have hair

Anything else is more than quite rare
It never happens anywhere

I could do that miracle, though
But I want you to know
You reap what you sow'
