return @"Huryy, another poem write.

There comes a time when to write is right.

There comes a time when to write the right is a hard fought fight

But to write the right in a hard fought fight, is much harder when done at night

The night fight that has to write, must be right or face a fright!

To write the right in dark of night and avoid a fright, you need a light.
A bright one.
