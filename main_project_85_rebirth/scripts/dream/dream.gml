return @"The grass too sharp for me to touch,
The green a poison that kills too much.

The sterile white inside my room,
Is safety at its peak.
But across the room my eyeballs sneak.
They peek a peek week by week.

The grass looks softer than before
The white inside seems such a bore

I hear my name in the fields outside,
But the watchful eyes have me tied.
I sat down and cried.
Have I died?

...Dream?...
Smooth Speaking Sal"
