return @"A starry night,
A lack of light,
The crickets chirping their song.

The day is done,
Gone is the sun,
But the night has just begun.

The dreams will flow
With firefly glow
Throughout the wisping trees.

But few can guide
The glowing tide
To the sleeping child's side

Those who do
Must stay true
To the dark where they abide. 

Shadows scamper through the woods.
Carrying very precious goods.
Their destination is in sight,
But what do they see?
A blinding light.

They huddle together,
What should we do?
Should we stop here?
Or should we go through? 

The risk too great for all to bear
They turn away,
With deep despair. 

But one stops and makes his plea.
'If none will go, then please send me.'

Into his hands they place the sack,
Filled with dreams they're giving back.

He slowly walks towards his fate
'Can't turn back now,  
It's far too late.'

With all his strength
He dives ahead.
The light is burning
From feet to head.

What seems like years is just a flash
What felt a crawl the quickest dash.

He now arrives
The danger is clear
The others cease 
Their trembling fear.

Beside a bed he proudly stands
With the dreams held in his hands

He dusts them on a sleeping child
And on her face he sees a smile.

So off they go to catch more dreams,
It's more important than it seems.
