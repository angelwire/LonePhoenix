return @"The rhymes will flow
Like slippery snow

From brain to hand
Like grains of sand

From heart to soul
The waves will roll

Ambiguity my ally
Poetry my war cry

I'll fight the horde
With pen not sword

For none can kill
The purest will

Voices in the sea of life
Drowning in its secret strife

They know not why
Their brothers die

No answer found
No solid ground

Connect the dots
The battles fought

The wars that raged
The drowning saved

From sinking sand
This broken land
