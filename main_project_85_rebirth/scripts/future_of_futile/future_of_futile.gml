return @"White to green,
to gold to brown.

Snowflakes then rain
Then leaves fall down

The days move on
The seasons roll

They give their gifts
They take their toll

With death
Comes health

With rags
Comes wealth

The coin is flipped
The bottom top

The baton passed
Will never drop

In with new
Out with old

Gone is warm
In comes cold.";
