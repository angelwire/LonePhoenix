return @"Mac McGurney's book 'Successful Business' has inspired me.  Today I will begin the first of the five phases he said would lead to success.  I will begin my dream.

My dream is to own every business in the town.  The hotel, cafe, store, messenger post, and start even more businesses here in town.  One day I will.
--
My plan is to start working at the messenger post.  I'll start working my way up to the top.  As soon as I control what people read, I'll begin controlling what they think.
--
I haven't told anyone about my plan.  I doubt they would understand anyway.
--
Part 3 of the book begins now, I'll act on my plans.
--
I've finally got a job at the messenger post.  Someone has to clean out the bird cages.
--
First week of the job over now.  Who knew the birds could make such a mess?  At work today I asked my boss why these birds weren't rabid like all the other animals.  He chuckled and said 'I wish I knew.'
--
I can't believe it's only been a year since I started working at the messenger station.  There's still no sign of me being promoted to news or anything.  If I don't hear anything about getting promoted by next month, I might have to do something drastic.
--
Still no sign of being promoted.  I've got a plan to help speed things along though.  I'll sneak in tonight and mix together a couple of my boss' news stories.  In the morning I'll let the boss know about the mistake.  I'll suggest that he's overworked and needs to hire someone to help write the news.
--
'Boy with blue face finds rock' sounds better than 'Boy finds rock with blue face.'  Tomorrow is the day.
--
It worked.  I'm now the official news editor.  Another step in the right direction.
--
For my 16th birthday my boss gave me another promotion!  I'm slowly starting to take over the messenger station.
--
At this rate the station will be mine by the time I'm 17.  Things are going good!
--
A lot of people are complaining about my boss leaving the messenger post to someone as young as me.  They don't realize the whole town will be mine someday!
--
Now that I've got the messenger post, I'll soon be on my way to taking the rest of the town's businesses.   The townspeople are already starting to get a little suspicious of my ambition; so I'll need to proceed very inconspicuously. 
--
Now begins plan 4 of Mac McGurney's book.  I must keep a constant lookout for any opportunities to take control of the rest of the town's businesses. 
--
While I'm looking for opportunities I'll also be constantly building the messenger post into something better.  Something more profitable.   Since the only income that I get comes from the town, I'll need to be friends with the mayor.
--
Forget the mayor!  Opportunity has not only knocked on my door, but also opened it and waltzed right on in.  This impending battle between us and the Indians has left the cafe and hotel in very dire shape.  I'm certain that the battle will result in our victory, and things will return to normal.  Except I'll be in control of 2 of the town's 3 biggest business!
--
The big businessmen are going off to war, with the deeds to their businesses in my hands!  This is such a great day!  They'll go, win the battle, come back, and I'll be the boss!
--
That stupid general store owner!  I'm offering her enough money to never have to work again!  She won't sell.  I'll need some way to convince her.
--
Once again I have a plan.  The general store owner's son has fallen madly in love with me.  All I have to do is get him to do something illegal that will send him to jail.  When his mother doesn't have the money to bail him out, I'll step in.
--
Money wasn't meant to be held hostage by simpletons without a dream.  Money was meant to turn people that dream into people that plan, people that work into people that win.
--
At the ripe young age of 18 years old, I've conquered the town.  While I may be young, money is ageless.
--
Part 5 of Mac McGurney's book is the hardest.  People can't seem to understand my success.  Everyone in the town thinks I horde money.  But in fact, the fools that need help are often the ones too proud to ask for it.
--
Stupid people.  Of course I'm going to throw their kids in jail when they tear apart my hotel.  What do they expect?
--
This 'success' is starting to hurt.
I earned everything I got.  Everything I did was legal.  Having ambition isn't wrong.  No one can see that.";
