return @"The catastrophe happened from out of nowhere.  No one could have possibly guessed what happened that fateful day.  It was as if the animals turned into the very incarnation of evil.  Lambs turned into wolves, kittens into lions.  They all had one goal: to slaughter as many humans as possible.  Had we been even the slightest bit prepared we could have saved many more lives.  But as it is, just the few of us from Lone Buzzard survived.  Some of the Indians from a nearby village survived as well.  And I heard that the group of oriental immigrants made it safely underground somewhere.  For all we know, the rest of the world could be completely destroyed.  We were lucky to find this cave when we did.  They might not have been so lucky.  We could very well be the last humans on the earth.  But we will rebuild.  Lone Buzzard was buried underneath this mountain of calamity, but the Lone Phoenix will rise.

Editor's Note: This was written by Founder Haggarai Doohley in his journal the day before Lone Phoenix was founded.  He was instrumental in inspiring the remaining population.";
