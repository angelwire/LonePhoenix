return @"Justice - Author Unkown

Roses are red
Violets are blue.
I hate you so much
And your mother too.
You make me so mad when you act nice to the pack
Then come up behind them and stab them in the back.
When they beg you for mercy
You just spit in their face.
When the sherriff is chasing you
You pick up the pace
But you can't run fast enough
And you end up in the rack.   
When they take you to the rope
There will be no more hope.
