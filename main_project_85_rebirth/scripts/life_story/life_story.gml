Regarding those that ask for my life's story,
Here it is in all its glory
(Or lack thereof)

It starts with my birth
My mother was relieved of an enormous girth
(I have been doing good deeds since)

I've always been a child of light
I've always had a peculiar plight
(But I am normal though)

My fourteenth birthday I received a pot
I loved that pot, it was the only present I got
(It was a bluish periwinkle colored pot)

I named it Jonah, from the story with the whale
And boy was I surprised when it birthed a baby pail!
(I renamed it Susan after I found out it was a girl, and the pail I named Jonah) 

My father tried to buy me a pet
A psychologist he called it
(I was happy playing with Susan and Jonah though)

My parents took me to a small white room in a big white house
I cried a lot in there
(I was sad)

I used a pen and drew a hole in the wall
I walked right through it into the hall
(I still don't know how that happened, they usually didn't let me have pens in my room)

A mustache on my face I drew,
And with my disguise I snuck right through
(Again, I still don't know how I acquired the pen)

So out of the doors and into the life
Where I found my lovely wife
(She's very short)

She cooks me cheese
And always says please
(I like cheese)
