return @"What light for yonder window shakes
The awful luck, the awful breaks

The singing frog that knows the song
The birdies whistling all day long

The falling tree has no regrets
The haughty gambler wins no bets

But through the mire the black bird flies
And for the clouds the chicken sighs

...Mimicking...
Smooth Speaking Sal";
