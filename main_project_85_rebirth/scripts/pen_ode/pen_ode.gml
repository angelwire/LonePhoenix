return @"Come back here yon pen
For I shall chase you 'til the earth desist
Thine efforts so vain
These futile dreams you must not persist

The fair maidens heart 
You cannot keep from my power
Thou shalt mark upon this parchment
The words that will win her this hour

Make haste my slave
Thine ink shall write my heart
To make the sharpest prose
To pierce her majestic heart

For sooth what fate has befallen me?
The one I love is not a queen!
A cow in a dress quite odd
How greatful I am that this lie I have seen!
