return @"Round not square
Devoid of hair
Some may stare
While others don't care

Filled with hot air
The inside is bare.
You really should care
'Bout the head of your mayor!

Orville Granton has only been a hinderance to the growth and progress of our fair town.
Vote Jeremy Jamesly for your next mayor!"
