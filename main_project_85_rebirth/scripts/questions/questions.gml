return @"Why does the rain fall down
Does it not want to go up?
Why is it so attached to the ground
Why does it not want to fly above the clouds?
In the sky with the birds?
Do all raindrops love the earth so much?
That they would say farewell to the blue?
And come to the green?
What are they saying, what do they mean?
Is it a clue? Is it a sign?
Or is it something unseen?
An unknown entity?
Oh yeah, gravity.
