return @"My right big toe I've lost today,
It was my favorite, I must say.
Itâ€™s perfect curves were beauty fine,
It was my favorite, for it was mine.
The color such a golden brown,
It was my favorite, now I frown.
Where could it be, I've got to know.
It was my favorite, my right big toe.

...My Right Big Toe...
