return @"'I love you so much
You know that it's true
I love you so much
I realy like you'

'You really love me?'
'I really do.'
'Are you sure you love me?'
'Yes, you turn my face blue.'

'But what about Sally?
You loved her before.'
'That girl is boring
She makes me snore.'

'When I loved another
I was really blind
But I love you now
Because you're really kind.'

'But what about my looks?
Don't you like them as well?'
'Of course I do.
You shine like a bell.'

'You're so sweet
The things you say
I'm going to love you
every day.'
