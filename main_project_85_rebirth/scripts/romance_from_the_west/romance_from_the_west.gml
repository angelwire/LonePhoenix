return @"Love is so wonderfully grand
Love is great
It don't show hate
Which in actuality makes it bland

'I love you so much you hunk of honey'
'I love you too pumpkin baby doll'
'Have i ever told you youre handsome and tall?
By the way, can I have some money?'

'Take what you want my lovely queen'
'Oh I most certainly will'
'Yay, I get more bills'
'Youre so wonderful, I dont know why people think youre mean,'

'Who says I mean?'
'My mother of course'
'Your mother I've seen
She looks like a horse'

'Okay. See you later'
Goodbye darlin'
