return @"'It's an oasis, Pa'
The child said
'We can get some water,
then we won't be dead.'

'We're saved!'
the father replied.
'Come on son!
I hope you haven't died!'

'I'm still alive, Pa
The sun ain't beat me yet
I'ma jump in the water
Then I'll be all wet'

So they ran to the water
Their salvation come
Water for their tummies
And trees to block the sun.
