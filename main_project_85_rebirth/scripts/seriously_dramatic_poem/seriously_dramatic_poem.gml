return @"The light streams through the barren trees
And none will hear our dying pleas.
Who can save our wretched souls,
From what is on the Lordâ€™s etched scrolls?

The fate of man has fallen down,
The earth has shed her pollen crown.
The beasts have risen to shred, devour.
Mankind will sleep this dread hour.
