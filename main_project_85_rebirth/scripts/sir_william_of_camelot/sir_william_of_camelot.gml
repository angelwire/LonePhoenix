return @"'Sir William of Camelot'

When adventure he sought,
Adventure he got.

His enemies rot,
When he's on the spot.

He fights when he ought,
And never gets caught.

One day he was shot-
Hit right on the dot-
But die he did not,
For he's tough as a cot.

Some dragons he fought,
He tamed the whole lot.

And while just a tot,
Tied a snake in a knot,
Stuck it in a pot,
And cooked it real hot.

You say this is what?
'A lie of a blot'?
That's quite the wrong thought!
Of Sir William of Camelot!
