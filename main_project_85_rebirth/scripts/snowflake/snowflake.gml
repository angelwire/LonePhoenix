return @"Falling through the sky
Floating with grace

Never thinking of the future
Perfectly paced

The grand blankets of fluff
Snow covered ground

Chilling joy throughout the air
Beautiful sound.

A picture of grand redemption
Death is buried

They're floating at the Maker's pace
Never hurried

Now melt away from our world
Gone too soon

From the death green appears
Life anew

Sprouts emerge from the soil
Towards the sky

Calling life from near and far
Sweet butterfly
