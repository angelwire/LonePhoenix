return@" 'Successful Business'
Written by Mac McGurney

After building my fortune, people often asked me, 'Mac, how do I build a large wealthy empire like yours?'  I soon get tired of routinely answering such an elementary question.   And when I saw the potential profit that could be made, I decided to write this book.  So do pay careful attention dear reader, what you read is the secret to building the same massive amount of wealth that I've accumulated. 

Step 1 - DREAM
While my incredible wealth wasn't built on dreams, that is where it all began.  If you don't ever dream of great wealth, you'll never achieve it.

Step 2 - PLAN
Once the dream of massive wealth has been firmly grounded into your very soul, begin planning for a solid foundation on which your dreams can launch. 

Step 3 - ACT
This is the simplest step, but yet the hardest.  When you've dreamed enough to plan, and planned enough to act, it's time to act.  Overcome your fear of failure and get out there!

Step 4 - SEE
This is the step that separates the successful, from the ultra-wealthy like me.  While acting and building your empire, constantly be on the lookout for opportunities to further expand your kingdom, and in turn, your wealth.  Never be content with the success you've already had.  Always look to get richer. 

Step 5 - IGNORE
Ignore the naysayers.  Money does make you happy.  You earned your money.  You don't have to give a single dime to anyone.

And there you have it.  Mac McGurney's guide to excessive wealth.";
