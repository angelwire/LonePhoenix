return @"The bravest man in all the west
Was big and strong
And looked the best

He jumped a river to catch a thief
He tied him up
With a handkerchief 

Tied a snake to a cougar's tail
Hit it in the face
With an empty pail

Only scared of just one thing
The prison called
A wedding ring

He doesn't smoke or drink or lie
He's never mean
And a generous guy

When his work here was finally done
He left his home
To chase the sun

We can only guess just where he went
Some say to Europe
Some the orient

Though he's gone he still lives on
Inside the hearts
That hear this song

-Archibald Peryciville";
