return @"The chips danced in his fingers
He had an ace up his sleeve
Lady luck was with him
But soon, he knew she'd leave

The cards were dealt
Now on the table
He knew he'd win
His kings were able

With a steely gaze he placed his bet
And one by one the others left
But there was one who didn't flinch
This winning hand would be a synch

The stakes were raised
He wasn't fazed
Higher still
He held his will

The final call
His cards revealed
He had won
His victory sealed

He gathered all the chips
And turned towards the door
But a gunshot to his back
Knocked him to the floor

'I should'a seen it coming
But I turned my back to you
Now you've ruined my new shirt
What an awful thing to do'

He pulled a big iron from his hip
And with the speed of lightning
Let the bullets rip

He stood up
And walked out the door
As the back shooter fell
And died there on that floor
