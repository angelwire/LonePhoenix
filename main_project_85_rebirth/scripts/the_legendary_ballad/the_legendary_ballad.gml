return @"'Howdy son!' the gunman shouted
'Draw on me and you'll be outed'

'What's that mean?' The young one cried
'You'll be dead.' the old replied

'How would I die' he questioned more
'I'd shoot you dead, and you'd hit the floor'

'Why would I pull a gun on a Grey-haired pop?'
'Don't question me more, you'd better stop!'

'One more, query, if I may good man'
'One last question, that's all I'll stand.'

'If I can close my eyes, and see you still,
Could the cafe owner give you my bill?'

'What's for me, if you cain't?'
'Well, I'll dip my face in purple paint.'

'It'd be a great laugh, you've got a deal,
Close your eyes and see me still'

The young kid closed his open eyes,
And told the old man, 'I'm much too wise,

I see you now as clear as day,
I win you lose, now go and pay.'

The old man thought, and said 'wait up now!'
'how do I know, you aren't cheatin' somehow?'

'I'll turn around and see you still,
Then you must go and pay my bill.'

'But there's a mirror on the wall, you'd cheat again!'
'Well I'll go outside and then I'll win'

'But the windows, they'll let you see me!'
'I'll ride out of town then, and it'll still be easy.

But I own no animal to ride upon, might I shortly use your horse'
'Go right ahead, It'll help me prove you wrong of course.'

So the boy rode away, in the old man's saddle
He sold it soon, And bought some cattle.

When he saw the truth, the old man felt faint,
'The store don't sell, no purple paint!'
