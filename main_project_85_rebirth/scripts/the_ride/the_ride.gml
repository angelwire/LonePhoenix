return @"Down the tracks the minecart rolls

Down the track around the poles

Over bumps and over holes

Crashing really takes its tolls

The darkness will consume your soul

The rats will then gnaw upon your soles

But light does not sleep on patrol

It will come and make you whole

...The Ride...
Smooth Speaking Sal";
