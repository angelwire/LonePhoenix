return @"To my young student
These words you should really listen to
Not to brag
But I've got a lot of money in my bag

Here's what you do
To be as good as me
Pracitce,
Oh, and a buffalo you must kiss

Why? You ask
Because that's the rule
Poets must be prepared 
To act the fool

'But we're sophisticated' you say
'Not some stupid jester'
Jesters are poets
They just don't know it

We are jesters too
But you know it though
You've gotta make people happy
Don't be stuck up and sappy

Be honest,
Be simple,
Be true,
Wait did that sound redundant to you?
Redundancy I hate
It makes me so mad
I hate repetition
That's my position.
