return @"'2 Knights, A Dragon, and a Peasant'

Two knights fought a dragon
For the hand of the princess
She wanted its skin
For a fancy new dress

One knight had a sword
The other a dagger
The battle was fierce
But neither would stagger

The dragon blew fire
From all five of its noses
But both the knights dodged
Using elegant poses

The knight with a sword
Swung at the beast
While the knight with the dagger
Poked at its feet

Lasting for days,
The battle waged on
But with the flap of its wings
The dragon was gone

The knights were discouraged
For the dragon retreated
That cowardly dragon
Was nearly defeated

As they sat on the ground
And rested themselves
Along came a chicken,
A cow, and three elves

The elves then explained
That they saw the battle
From beginning to end
While tending their cattle

They saw that the dragon
Flew south to the castle
And tracking him down
Would not be a hassle

The knights both said 'thanks'
And took off for the dragon
But they soon came across
A burnt broken wagon

At the front of the wagon
Was a young peasant maiden
With tears in her eyes
And a heart heavy laden

She asked for the knights
To give her some aid
But in their haste they ignored her
And they both rode away

But along came the chicken
The cow and the elves
And said 'Those two knights
Are full of themselves'

'We will help you ma'am
We'll get your wagon fixed right.
You'll be on your way,
And home before night '

The elves fixed the wagon
In the blink of an eye.
She thanked them profusely
And then waved goodbye

She drove down the road
And soon passed the knights
Who couldn't believe
What they saw with their eyes

The peasant was hauling
In the back of the wagon
The treasure they wanted:
The skin of the dragon

She went to the castle
And there earned her prize
Wile the knights both sat down
And cried out their eyes
