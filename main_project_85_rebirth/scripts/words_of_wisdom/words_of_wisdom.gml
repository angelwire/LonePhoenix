return @"Wiley Willie's Words of Wisdom

Let your actions speak so loud that your words are merely whispers

If you want to lose weight, put it where you can't find it

The largest rat can be devoured by an average eagle

The faster one moves, the sooner one approaches adversity

The slower one moves, the harder it is to escape regret

Clouds often float on by, but never stop to say 'goodbye'

Trees can wave to say 'hello' but often fail to let you know

Though fields of wheat are large, and fields of water larger, fields of flowers are best

Trickling thoughts are good company
